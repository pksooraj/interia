Imagine transforming your living space with a flick of your wrist. This open-source Android project unlocks the power of Augmented Reality (AR) to revolutionize interior design. Ditch the tape measure and blurry mental images – visualize furniture in your real-world environment before you buy or rearrange.

Effortlessly Experiment, Confidently Decorate:

Drag and Drop Magic: Unleash your inner designer with a vast library of 3D furniture models. Experiment with various styles, from modern chic to classic farmhouse, all at your fingertips.
Seamless AR Integration: Experience furniture come to life in your space! Cutting-edge markerless tracking ensures virtual furniture interacts realistically with walls, floors, and existing décor.
Intuitive Resizing: Fine-tune furniture dimensions on the fly to achieve perfect proportions. No more wondering if that new sofa will overpower your living room.
Informed Decisions: Say goodbye to buyer's remorse! Visualizing furniture in your actual space eliminates sizing concerns, allowing you to make confident purchasing choices.
Built with the Future in Mind:

Powered by Google AR Core: This project leverages a robust platform for accurate environment mapping, ensuring a smooth and immersive AR experience.
Open Source Collaboration: Dive into the code and contribute your ideas! This project welcomes contributions to push the boundaries of AR interior design.
This isn't just furniture placement – it's a design playground!
